    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to run. In other words, it tells us how the execution time of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity remains relatively low even for larger inputs. Developers strive to design algorithms with better time complexity to ensure faster execution and better user experiences.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is another essential aspect of algorithm analysis. It focuses on the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses to solve a problem based on the input size. Just like time complexity, space complexity also matters, especially in environments with limited memory resources. Space complexity is often expressed using the notation <b>O(n)</b>, where 'n' represents the input size. Algorithms with lower space complexity are generally preferred, as they can optimize memory usage and contribute to overall system efficiency.</p>
